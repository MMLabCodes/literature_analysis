# Automated Literature Analysis

This repository shows an example of how to perform an automated analysis of peer-reviewed scholar literature using Jupyter notebooks, Scopus, and Lens citation database. This analysis detects the number of publications over time, popular authors, popular venues, popular affiliations, and popular "topics" that appear within the documents' abstracts (detected using natural language processing).

# Requirements

The notebook requires access to Scopus: A citation database of peer-reviewed literature from scientific journals, books, and conference proceedings. To utilize the Scopus API, you (or your institute) needs a Scopus Python API `pip3 install scopus==1.6.0` and you must request an Elsevier Developer API key (see [Elsevier Developers](https://dev.elsevier.com/sc_apis.html) for more information).

The required Python packages can be found in requirements.txt. Creating a virtual Python environment is recommended (for example, virtualenv or conda). The notebook has been tested using Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.

Last, you may need to install the library `pip3 install PyYAML`. Using `pip3 list` to check the PyYAML (5.1.1) version.

# Running the Notebook

After installing the dependencies, use `jupyter notebook literature_analysis.ipynb` to launch the notebook. Remaining instructions can be found within the notebook itself.

# Examples

```
query = 'title-abs-key("evolving neural network" AND ("deep learning" OR "object recognition"))' 
```
